# Pokle

**Introduction**
---------------

Pokle is a Wordle-like game but themed around Pokemon. There are 897 possible pokemon to guess from. Guesses will only comprise of letters, so no special characters, numbers, or spaces. For exampole this means Nidoran male and Nidoran female are combined into the same pokemon Nidoran, Porgyon 2 becomes PorygonTwo, and Mr. Mime becomes MrMime.

Future goals: 
* Update correctly guessed letters in the wrong spot so that they don't show up if there are multiples
* Bring in the Pokemon types to help with guesses
* Show Pokemon art at gameover screen
* Include a help button modal with rules
* Change artstyle to match pokemon themeing and in general make the CSS prettier
